Specifically, the ROK may consider the following four public health measures: Ensure that all hospitals have comprehensive hospital infection control measures in place and that medical staff are trained to ask for overseas travel history from all ill patients and their families in the emergency room. This is in recognition that the â€œpoint of entryâ€ of infectious diseases is no longer at the border (airport or seaport), but rather â€œat the doorâ€ of the local hospital where the travellers who become ill after arrival will seek medical care. Ensure that travellers have access to pre-travel health information, vaccinations and necessary medications (e.g., malaria prophylaxis). To some extent, this is being met by current services such as the KCDC Call Centre (1339). Ensure that travellers have access to post-travel information on what to do and whom to call if they become ill after returning from their trip. To some extent, this is being met by current services. Maintain trained quarantine officials at major POEs to respond and assess ill persons on board reported by the captains of vessels. Ensure that there are rapid transportation systems to designated hospitals if hospitalization is warranted and that there is sufficient information to identify and locate possible contacts of ill persons."
