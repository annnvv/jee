explore other public health measures to limit the impact and spread of imported infectious diseases.
Specifically, the ROK may consider the following four public health measures:
Ensure that all hospitals have comprehensive hospital infection control measures in place and that
medical staff are trained to ask for overseas travel history from all ill patients and their families in
the emergency room. This is in recognition that the “point of entry” of infectious diseases is no
longer at the border (airport or seaport), but rather “at the door” of the local hospital where the
travellers who become ill after arrival will seek medical care.
Ensure that travellers have access to pre-travel health information, vaccinations and necessary
medications (e.g., malaria prophylaxis). To some extent, this is being met by current services such
as the KCDC Call Centre (1339).
Ensure that travellers have access to post-travel information on what to do and whom to call if
they become ill after returning from their trip. To some extent, this is being met by current services.
Maintain trained quarantine officials at major POEs to respond and assess ill persons on board
reported by the captains of vessels. Ensure that there are rapid transportation systems to
designated hospitals if hospitalization is warranted and that there is sufficient information to
identify and locate possible contacts of ill persons."
poe	Points of Entry	KOR	Korea	"Consider conducting cost-effectiveness studies of the current border health measures and quarantine
